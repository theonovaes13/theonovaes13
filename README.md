## Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Theo, I'm a software engineer mainly focused on Ruby on Rails at the moment.

My interests, besides webdev, are skateboarding, practicing judo and going on *fast* bike rides.

I also try to develop some games in my spare time, but since my spare time has been so little, there's almost a year I dont write a single line in a game. (written in jan/2022)

Fun fact: In one of my endeavors, I actually ran over a car (since I was the one that was moving, and it was the one that was stationary). This little oopsie got me 16 stitches on the face and 8 on the wrist, since I literally went full superman through the windshield. Guys, seriously, use helmets.

Welcome, and remember to be good.
