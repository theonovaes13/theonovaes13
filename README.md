## Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Theo, I'm a software engineer mainly focused on Ruby on Rails and Vue.js at the moment.

My interests, besides webdev, are skateboarding, practicing judo and going on *fast* bike rides.

I also try to develop some games in my spare time.

Welcome, and remember to be good.
